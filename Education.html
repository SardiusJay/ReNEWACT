       former Principal Investigator of the Environment and Energy Sustainability Research Program at 
       Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He received his PhD degree in the year 2018 from 
       the Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China in Environmental Engineering.
        He has served as the Science Communication Officer of the Global Interdisciplinary Program on
           "Health and Urban Wellbeing (an interdisciplinary body of the International Science Council) based in China and Italy. Dr. Abass has contributed more than 40 publications in high quality internationally referred journals and conference papers. He is a recipient of several prestigious awards including the TWAS and Fondazione Internazionale grant award in Italy, CAS-TWAS President Fellowship award, China, the Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship award from NTU, Singapore, and recently awarded a Visiting Scientist of the Presidential International Fellowship Initiative program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Currently, he is serving as a Senior Lecturer/Associate Researcher at the Department of Civil Engineering, Landmark University (LMU), Nigeria (A Global Rising Star University). He is also a member of various international water and engineering societies, including IWA (International Water Association), MRS (Materials Research Society), APISE (Asia-Pacific Institute of Science and Technology), and a registered Engineer with Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN). He has held several positions within the University such as SDGs – 9 Coordinator, Final Year Project Coordinator, and Postgraduate Coordinator for the Department of Civil Engineering, LMU. Through his current position as Head, ReNEWACT Laboratories, Landmark University, he leads a team of researchers and students working on interdisciplinary approach to mitigating the effects of climate change in Africa and ensuring resource sustainability. As a Senior Lecturer, he has delivered research-led teaching in environmental engineering and pollution control at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. He has led modules on topics such as ‘Environmental Engineering Systems Design’, ‘Advanced Water and Wastewater Engineering’, “Environmental Pollution and Control’ and ‘Urban Environment and Management of Municipal Services’. In addition to teaching, he has supervised research projects undertaken by students at bachelor, masters and PhD levels.  His current research is primarily divided into three integrated areas; Sustainable Environment System Design, Green Catalysis for Sustainable Environment and Decarbonization via Resource Recovery and Energy Conversion.
His entire career revolves around creating sustainable solutions to some of world’s pressing challenges including water, air, and energy. He is able to achieve this via his teaching and research philosophy: “Create a Collaborative and Community Impact Innovation driven by Social, Economic and Technological Need”. His futuristic idea is to create enabling environment for an all-inclusive human health and well-being.
